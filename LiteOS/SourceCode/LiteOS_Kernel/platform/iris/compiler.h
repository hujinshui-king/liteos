   clock frequency (in Hertz).

   The maximal possible delay is 262.14 ms / F_CPU in MHz.

 * well as two different levels of preprocessor concetanations in
 * order to do both, assign the correct interrupt vector name, as well
 * as construct a unique function name for the ISR.
 *
 * Do *NOT* try to reorder the macros below, or you'll suddenly find
