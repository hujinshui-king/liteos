 * \brief This files defines the API for the Transceiver Access Toolbox.
 *
 *      This file contains the function prototypes for the Transceiver Access 
 *      Toolbox, hence it is an API. The Transceiver Access Toolbox is an
 *      abstraction layer that hides the details of the radio transceiver from 
 *      the end-user. The goal for the Transceiver Access Toolbox is to wrap the 
 *      services that the radio transceiver can perform into easy to use functions.

/*! \mainpage Transceiver Access Toolbox
 *
 * \section secIntroduction Introduction
 * The Transceiver Access Toolbox is implemented as an easy-to-use library that 
 * covers most of the functionality provided by the AT86RF230 radio transceiver. 
 * The library is completely written in the C programming language.
 *
 * \subsection secMisra MISRA Compliance
 * The Transceiver Access Toolbox is MISRA Compliant to the required rule set,
 * with the following exceptions:
 *    -# Rule 1: No compiler extensions allowed. Comment: Not possible to meet, 
 *               since we are on an embedded target where interrupts are needed.
 *    -# Rule 37: Bitwise operations is not allowed on signed integer types. 
 *                Comment: This is an error in the MISRA parser, since no singned 
 *                variable is used. Problem seams to be in stdint.h. 
 *    -# Rule 54: Null statement can only be on a line by itself. Comment: Triggered 
 *                by the AVR_ENTER_CRITICAL_REGION macro. This macro can be 
 *                written out so that the error goes away. The macro is only 
 *                used for convenience.
 *    -# Rule 71: No prototype seen. Comment: This error orginates from how 
 *                interrupt handlers are implemented in IAR.
 *    -# Rule 96: Function like macro shall be enclosed in parenthesis. Comment: 
 *                Triggered by the AVR_ENTER_CRITICAL_REGION macro. 
 *                This macro can be written out so that the error goes away. 
 *                The macro is only used for convenience and readability of the 
 *                code.
 *
 * \subsection secCompileOptions Compile Options
 *
 *    -# F_CPU: The clock speed of the CPU must be defined. The current 
 *              implementation supports 1, 4, 8 and 16 MHz operation. Example:
 *              # define F_CPU=8000000UL
 *    -# ARCHITECTURE: AVR is the only currently supported architecture. 
 *                     Example: # define AVR
 *
 *    See the examples directory for further information on how to set up the 
 *    IAR or avr-gcc toolchains to define these symbols.
 *
 * \defgroup tat Transceiver Access Toolbox API
 *      The Transceiver Access Toolbox API is a set of functions that provides the
 *      end user with total access to all functionality in the radio transceiver, 
 *      without dealing with its registers and internal dynamics.
